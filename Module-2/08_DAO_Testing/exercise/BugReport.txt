Test that demonstrates problem:
public void getTimesheetsByProjectId_with_valid_id_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project()

Code:

    public List<Timesheet> getTimesheetsByProjectId(int projectId) {
        List<Timesheet> timesheets = new ArrayList<>();
        String sql = "SELECT timesheet_id, employee_id, project_id, date_worked, hours_worked, billable, description " +
                "FROM timesheet " +
                "WHERE employee_id = ? " +
                "ORDER BY timesheet_id;";
        //employee_id is wrong

Expected output: 2

Actual output: 1
