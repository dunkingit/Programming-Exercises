Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
    getStates_returns_all_states
Expected output:
    getState() returns a list of 3 states
Actual output:
    getState() was returning a list of 1 state
How did you fix this bug?
    Replaced if(results.next()) with while(results.next()) in getState() so all results are processed.
